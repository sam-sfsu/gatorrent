    <h1><u>About us</u></h1>
    <p>San Francisco is the cultural, commercial, and financial center of Northern California 
        that is being flooded by talents from all over the world. Housing prices are skyrocketing 
        as competition to live within the 49 sq mi block increases every day. SFSU students are being 
        forced to compete in this frenzied market as these incoming professionals are starting to trickle into 
        outskirts of San Francisco where the students reside. Fortunately, SFSU students have an exclusive 
        access to GatorRent. This is the SFSU student exclusive apartment renting website that eliminates the unnecessary 
        competition. Students wonâ€™t have to send countless emails to lessor and wait for a long time to hear responses. 
        Due to the exclusive audiences, there will be a better upkeep to prevent spammers and fake post. 
        Students will receive the attention they deserve with the commitment and services that GatorRent provides. 
        GatorRent is also an excellent website for other companies to invest in. Marketer will be able to spend reasonably 
        when trying to market to students in broad areas. GatorRent will do the work by collecting and isolating the students, 
        giving marketer the opportunity to advertise effectively and efficiently if they choose to advertise within our website.
